# High-Performance Training Configuration
# For Maximum Teacher Accuracy (90%+ target)

# Training Philosophy:
# - Strong teachers → Strong student
# - Distillation loses 10-20% accuracy
# - Need 90%+ teacher to get 70%+ student

object_cognition:
  # Model Architecture - LARGE for 70%+ IoU
  hidden_dim: 512        # Large capacity (8x baseline)
  num_layers: 4          # Very deep for complex patterns
  
  # Training
  learning_rate: 0.001   # Lower for stability with larger model
  batch_size: 64         # Larger batches
  max_epochs: 500        # Train until full convergence
  patience: 40           # More patience for larger model
  
  # Regularization
  weight_decay: 0.0001   # L2 regularization
  dropout: 0.15          # More dropout for larger model
  
  # Data - MUCH MORE
  train_size: 15000      # Huge curriculum for diversity
  val_size: 3000
  test_size: 3000
  grid_size_range: [3, 15]  # Varied sizes including small
  
  # Success Criteria
  target_accuracy: 0.70  # 70%+ IoU on test set
  max_generalization_gap: 0.15  # <15% train-test gap

numerosity:
  # Model Architecture - LARGER for exact counting!
  hidden_dim: 512        # Doubled from 256
  num_layers: 3          # 3 layers sufficient
  
  # Training
  learning_rate: 0.001   # Lower LR for larger model
  batch_size: 32         # Reduce batch size (larger model)
  max_epochs: 300        # Should converge faster
  patience: 15           # Reduced patience
  
  # Regularization
  weight_decay: 0.0001   # L2 regularization
  dropout: 0.2           # More dropout (larger model)
  
  # Data
  train_size: 20000      # More data for larger model
  val_size: 4000
  test_size: 4000
  grid_size_range: [3, 15]  # Same range
  
  # Success Criteria
  target_accuracy: 0.90  # 90%+ exact match

# Rationale:
# - 256 hidden dim: Enough capacity for complex patterns
# - 3 layers: Deep enough for hierarchical features
# - 300 epochs: Let model fully converge
# - Cosine LR decay: Better final convergence
# - 10K train tasks: Prevent overfitting through diversity
